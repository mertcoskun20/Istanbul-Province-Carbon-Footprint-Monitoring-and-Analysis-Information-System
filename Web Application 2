We managed to be among the last 9 finalists with our project called Istanbul Province Carbon 
Footprint, which we prepared for the Sustainable Cities Hackathon, to which 1000+ people applied.
Sustainable Cities Hackathon was organized jointly by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, Microsoft 
Turkey and Coderspace.io companies. When we examined the details of our project, a web 
application was designed with ArcGIS Pro by enlarging the carbon footprint information system we 
have made for the campus, and considering it within the scope of Istanbul. First of all, the carbon 
footprint was calculated for Istanbul. The carbon footprint calculation was calculated using the natural 
gas consumption and electricity consumption data of Istanbul districts published on the IBB Data 
portal, and the carbon emission released in Istanbul districts was calculated. Then, carbon emissions 
from the fuel consumption of IETT buses, electricity, natural gas and fuel consumption of metro and 
tram lines in Istanbul (using Metro Istanbul 2020 annual report data) were calculated. The carbon 
storage potential of the forests in Istanbul was calculated by image processing from the 30m resolution 
landsat satellite image. In addition to storage, solar panels and electrical energy obtained from garbage 
are also calculated as factors reducing carbon emissions. Using all these data, the total carbon footprint 
of the province of Istanbul was calculated. This analysis and results were converted into a web 
application using the Web Map plugin of the ArcGIS Pro application. Thus, by using digital 
technologies to struggle with climate change, it is expected to accelerate the impact of policies 
determined by decision makers. Decision makers can be determined as the IBB President, district 
mayors, general managers of public institutions and organizations, and in addition to these, the people 
of Istanbul.
